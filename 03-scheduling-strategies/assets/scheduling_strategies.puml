      Each thread gets N/P iterations in contiguous chunks
      where N = iteration count, P = number of threads

      Iterations distributed in round-robin chunks
      of size 2

      **#pragma omp for schedule(dynamic, 3)**
      Threads get 3 iterations at a time
      when they finish their previous work.
      Fast threads get more iterations.

      **#pragma omp for schedule(guided)**
      Thread gets decreasing chunk sizes
      starting with large chunks.
      Minimum chunk size of 1 by default.

      **#pragma omp for schedule(auto)**
      Scheduling is delegated to compiler/runtime
      to choose the best strategy
    end note

      Use OMP_SCHEDULE environment variable
      to specify scheduling at runtime
    end note

note bottom
  **Scheduling Strategy Selection Factors:**
  - **Static**: Best for evenly distributed workload with predictable iteration costs
  - **Dynamic**: Best for uneven workloads or when iteration costs vary significantly
  - **Guided**: Good for reducing scheduling overhead while handling imbalanced loads
  - **Auto**: Let the system choose based on its own heuristics
  - **Runtime**: Tune scheduling without recompiling
