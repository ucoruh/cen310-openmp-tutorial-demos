|Code Development|
partition "Common Issues" {
    :"Race Condition:\nMultiple threads modify the same variable\nwithout proper synchronization" as race #FFDDDD;
    note right #FFEEEE: Fix with critical, atomic,\nor private variables
    
    :"Load Imbalance:\nSome threads finish quickly\nwhile others have too much work" as imbalance #FFDDDD;
    note right #FFEEEE: Fix with dynamic/guided\nscheduling or tasks
    
    :"False Sharing:\nThreads access different variables\nthat share the same cache line" as falseSharing #FFDDDD;
    note right #FFEEEE: Fix with padding or\nrestructuring data access
    
    :"Over-parallelization:\nToo much overhead from\ncreating and managing threads" as overhead #FFDDDD;
    note right #FFEEEE: Only parallelize code with\nsufficient computation
}

|Performance Analysis|
partition "Profiling Tools" {
    :"Intel VTune\nAMD ÂµProf\nHPCToolkit" as profiling #DDEEDD;
    note right #EEFFEE: Identify hotspots and\nparallelization opportunities
    
    :"OMP_DISPLAY_ENV=true/verbose\nDisplay OpenMP environment variables" as env #DDEEDD;
    note right #EEFFEE: Verify configuration
}

|Performance Tuning|
partition "Optimization Strategies" {
    :"Thread Count Optimization:\nOMP_NUM_THREADS=optimal" as threadCount #DDDDFF;
    note right #EEEEFF: Find balance between\nparallelism and overhead
    
    :"Scheduling Strategy Optimization:\nschedule(static|dynamic|guided)" as scheduling #DDDDFF;
    note right #EEEEFF: Match work distribution\nwith workload pattern
    
    :"Data Locality Optimization:\nRestructure data access patterns" as locality #DDDDFF;
    note right #EEEEFF: Minimize cache misses
    
    :"Granularity Adjustment:\nMerge small tasks, split large ones" as granularity #DDDDFF;
    note right #EEEEFF: Balance overhead vs parallelism
    
    :"Hybrid Parallelism:\nCombine OpenMP with MPI\nfor distributed systems" as hybrid #DDDDFF;
    note right #EEEEFF: Scale beyond single node
}

|Debugging|

    note right #EEEEFF: View runtime configuration
    
    :"OMP_CANCELLATION=true\nomp_set_cancel()" as cancel #DDDDEE;
    note right #EEEEFF: Allow cancellation of regions
    
    :"Intel Inspector\nHelgrind (Valgrind)" as threadTools #DDDDEE;
    note right #EEEEFF: Detect race conditions,\ndeadlocks
    
    :"LLVM/GCC OpenMP debug flags\n-fopenmp-simd" as compilerFlags #DDDDEE;
    note right #EEEEFF: Compiler-specific debug options
