# 🛠️ OpenMP Debugging and Performance Optimization

This project demonstrates techniques for debugging OpenMP programs and optimizing their performance.

## 🎯 Overview

Debugging parallel programs is more challenging than debugging sequential code due to non-determinism, race conditions, and complex execution flows. This module covers common OpenMP issues and provides strategies for identifying and resolving them, as well as techniques for optimizing performance.

## 📊 OpenMP Debugging and Performance Optimization

The following diagram illustrates common issues and optimization strategies in OpenMP programs:

## 🧩 Common OpenMP Issues

### 1. Race Conditions

Race conditions occur when multiple threads access and modify the same data without proper synchronization:

```cpp
int counter = 0;

#pragma omp parallel for
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    counter++;  // Race condition: multiple threads updating counter
}
```

**Solution**: Use critical sections, atomic operations, or reduction clauses:

```cpp
int counter = 0;

#pragma omp parallel for reduction(+:counter)
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    counter++;  // Safe: using reduction
}
```

### 2. False Sharing

False sharing occurs when threads access different variables that share the same cache line:

```cpp
struct {
    int counter1;  // Thread 1 updates this
    int counter2;  // Thread 2 updates this
} shared_data;

// Threads repeatedly updating counter1 and counter2 cause cache line bouncing
```

**Solution**: Add padding or restructure data to avoid sharing cache lines:

```cpp
struct {
    int counter1;
    char pad1[60];  // Padding to ensure different cache lines
    int counter2;
    char pad2[60];
} shared_data;
```

### 3. Load Imbalance

Load imbalance occurs when some threads finish early while others continue working:

```cpp
#pragma omp parallel for schedule(static)
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    process(i);  // If process(i) takes varying time, static scheduling causes imbalance
}
```

**Solution**: Use dynamic or guided scheduling:

```cpp
#pragma omp parallel for schedule(dynamic)
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    process(i);  // Dynamic scheduling improves load balance
}
```

## 🔍 Debugging Techniques

### 1. Using Environment Variables

```bash
# Display OpenMP information at runtime
export OMP_DISPLAY_ENV=true

# Enable cancellation points for debugging
export OMP_CANCELLATION=true

# Show thread affinity information
export OMP_DISPLAY_AFFINITY=true
```

### 2. Using Runtime API Calls

```cpp
// Check if running in parallel region
if (omp_in_parallel()) {
    printf("Thread %d: In parallel region\n", omp_get_thread_num());
}

// Get nested level
int level = omp_get_level();
printf("Current parallel nesting level: %d\n", level);

// Get team size at a specific level
int team_size = omp_get_team_size(level);
printf("Team size at level %d: %d\n", level, team_size);
```

### 3. Using Cancellation Points

```cpp
#pragma omp parallel for
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    if (check_for_error(i)) {
        #pragma omp cancel for
    }
    
    // Process data
    
    #pragma omp cancellation point for
}
```

## 📈 Performance Optimization Strategies

### 1. Thread Count Optimization

Finding the optimal number of threads for your application:

```cpp
// Test different thread counts
for (int threads = 1; threads <= omp_get_max_threads(); threads++) {
    omp_set_num_threads(threads);
    
    double start_time = omp_get_wtime();
    // Run parallel code
    double end_time = omp_get_wtime();
    
    printf("Threads: %d, Time: %.4f seconds\n", threads, end_time - start_time);
}
```

### 2. Scheduling Strategy Optimization

Choose the best scheduling strategy for your workload:

```cpp
// Compare different scheduling strategies
const char* schedules[] = {"static", "dynamic", "guided"};
for (const char* sched : schedules) {
    setenv("OMP_SCHEDULE", sched, 1);
    
    double start_time = omp_get_wtime();
    #pragma omp parallel for schedule(runtime)
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        process(i);
    }
    double end_time = omp_get_wtime();
    
    printf("Schedule: %s, Time: %.4f seconds\n", sched, end_time - start_time);
}
```

### 3. Data Locality Optimization

Improve memory access patterns to reduce cache misses:

```cpp
// Optimized for row-major access (better locality)
#pragma omp parallel for
for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
        matrix[i][j] = compute(i, j);
    }
}
```
