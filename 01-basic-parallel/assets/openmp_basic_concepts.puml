note right of parallel
  Creates a team of threads
  that execute the block in parallel
end note

note right of for
  Distributes loop iterations
  among threads
end note

note right of private
  Each thread has its
  own copy of the variable
end note

note right of shared
  All threads access
  the same variable
end note

note bottom of num_threads
  Sets the number of threads
  for parallel regions
end note

note bottom of get_thread_num
  Returns the ID of the
  current thread (0 to N-1)
end note
